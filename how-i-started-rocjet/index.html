      <p>It wasn’t just another evening. It was <strong>the</strong> evening.</p>
      <p>On Wednesday, April 30th, 2025 — the same day I came back from writing my JAMB exam — something inside me shifted. I didn’t want to wait anymore. I had carried a dream for too long. That night, I officially started <strong>Rocjet Technologies Ltd</strong>.</p>
      <p>It was just me, my God, my phone, my logbook, my boldness — and a vision too big to ignore.</p>

      <h2>The birth of Rocjet wasn’t random</h2>
      <p>I had already designed the logo. I already had the name.</p>
      <p>The name <strong>“Rocjet”</strong> was an intentional misspelling of “Rocket” — to stand out, to feel original, to represent me. But because I was deep into JAMB preparations, I hadn’t acted on it.</p>
      <p>Until that evening.</p>
      <p>That night, I made my move. I created the business socials, picked the tools I needed, and opened my logbook like it was a launchpad.</p>
      <p>No confusion. No hesitation. Just momentum.</p>

      <h2>It wasn’t about perfection — it was about starting</h2>
      <p>There was no grand office. No funding. No team. Just a 15-year-old with fire in his bones and a global vision in his heart.</p>
      <p>I didn’t wait to “grow up.” I didn’t wait for permission. I built. I started.</p>
      <p>And that’s how <strong>Rocjet Technologies Ltd</strong> was born.</p>
