        <p>Today was a usual day, but it was the beginning of where one of my successes will begin, I think 🤔.</p>

        <p>As I woke up, I made some goals for the next 24 hours, which we call a "day".</p>

        <p>Then, I went into the street, picking some plastic waste and metal scraps so that I could sell them and get some real cash 😜.</p>

        <p>I decided to take one of my boldest steps and walk up to that recycling company and ask one of the workers any questions about what they do.</p>

        <p>I've always been highly interested. I've been eyeing this recycling company for a few weeks, imagining myself selling plastic waste and being paid real cash as a 15yo.</p>

        <p>I've also been imagining myself in a high-profile interview, but let's be honest, I've never been interviewed in my life.</p>

        <p>Today was different. Today was (or is) the day I decided to start picking, recycling, and selling plastic waste.</p>

        <p>Here's how it started.</p>

        <p>When I decided to stop picking those metal scraps early this morning and go directly to the company to inquire about what I'll be picking and what they are buying, I dressed up and prepared myself for all kinds of situations that might arise.</p>

        <p>Arriving there was the moment we've been waiting for.</p>

        <p>As I approached the company, I felt a mix of emotions - excitement, nervousness, and determination.</p>

        <p>I talked to the company's gateman, and after discussing, I understood some things that I needed to be doing. I thought it would end there, but then there was a "next moment".</p>

        <p>I clocked into the company like a real worker and met with the Secretary of the Company 😎. The lady was cheerfully looking at me, not as a common hustler but as a businessman with a brave idea of recycling waste.</p>

        <p>She explained to me some significant challenges in scavenging in dump sites, and I began to understand what I'll be doing. She gave me pieces of advice and told me to think about it later. She explained their buying rates for dried and empty sachet water packets and advised me to focus on sorting them to get a better price.</p>

        <p>She asked if I was pressurized by my parents; I told her, "They don't even know I'm here."</p>

        <p>She shared her own early days when she had such idea also after studying environmental science in uni, how she implemented them</p>

        <p>And how I could eventually turned this from just picking trash into a business</p>

        <p>I made my own research, did my own calculations, and set my own goals.</p>

        <p>And I officially began picking plastic waste today 🚀.</p>

        <p>Today was not just a simple street-to-street picking of pure water sachet trash. It was hectic – "Just think of it like a day in the job of a human garbage archaeologist, digging through mountains of waste to unearth hidden treasures of recyclable plastic."</p>

        <p>I picked with my bare hands, but I'll find gloves later. It was really itchy. I wasn't ashamed of what I was doing because I knew it would be worth it in the long run.</p>
