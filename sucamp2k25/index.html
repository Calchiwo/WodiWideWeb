        <p>It’s over.<br>
        The 2025 SU Camp has ended.<br>
        And honestly, I still feel the weight of it—in a good way.</p>

        <p>Thousands of people.<br>
        So many moments.<br>
        But somehow, I still found me in the middle of all the noise.</p>

        <p>This wasn’t just a camp.<br>
        It was a reset.<br>
        It pulled me out of “build mode” for a bit and brought me back to soul mode.<br>
        No code. No launch plans. Just presence.</p>

        <p>I didn’t try to meet everybody.<br>
        I didn’t try to shine.<br>
        I just showed up. Fully. Quietly.<br>
        And in that space, I got to breathe.</p>

        <p>I met a few people. Not many. But the ones I did meet? Real.<br>
        I listened more than I talked.<br>
        I watched. Reflected. Prayed.<br>
        Wrote a few things down that I’m not ready to share yet—but I will, in time.</p>

        <p>It’s wild that just being away from Rocjet for five days can make me see it clearer.<br>
        I’m still building. Still focused.<br>
        But now, with more peace.<br>
        More clarity.<br>
        More God.</p>

        <p>If you were at camp too—thank you.<br>
        Whether we talked or not, you were part of the energy that made this one unforgettable.</p>

        <p>If you weren’t—this is me just letting you in.<br>
        This was a moment for my blueprint. A page I’ll never erase.</p>

        <p>Done and dusted… but definitely not forgotten.</p>
